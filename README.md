# Chatgpt consolidate files into 1
This repository regroups the code you need to create a consolidated corpus file to upload into chatGPT for your analysis


## Prompt used for corpus txt file

I have uploaded a consolidated .txt file that contains multiple files separated by delimiters like this:

---
FILE: /path/to/document1.pdf
---
  1/  find all docs inside the .txt

2/ Please review the contents of the file, identify the different documents within it, and list all the files with a one-line description of each. Also, be prepared to help with detailed analysis or research based on the contents of any of these documents as needed.
